# BayLum `r RLumBuild::.get_pkg_version()` (`r Sys.Date()`)

**This version of `'BayLum'` requires R>=4.1.x!**

## New functions

### `create_DataFile()`

This function attempts to ease the very pain-stacking process of input data processing
(BIN/BINX files) so that it can be used in the `'BayLum'` modelling. The function is an entirely new development and will replace the functions `Generate_DataFile_MG()` and `Generate_DataFile()` in future versions of `'BayLum'`. Key features:

* Only one function for single-grain and multiple-grain data
* Support for BIN/BINX and XSYG files and `RLum.Analysis-class` objects, i.e. the data can be imported independently of the data file creation
* A new single-file configuration based on the YAML format. This makes the old error-prone folder structure obsolete 
* Various internal consistency checks to avoid input data are erroneousness; which may lead to very hard to-track-down error messages 
* Carries information about the number of samples and the sample names

### `write_YAMLConfigFile()`
This function supplements `create_DataFile()` supporting auto-generated YAML config
template files

## Bugfixes and changes

* Drop dependency to deprecated package `'ArchaeoPhases'` and make corresponding
code an internal function (PR #33, @nfrerebeau)

* Add dependencies to the packages `'yaml'` and `'cli'`

* Bump version requirement for `'Luminescence'` to >= v0.9.22

* Add new external files `example.yml` and `yaml_config_reference.yml` 

* `Age_Computation()` now determines the sample name automatically as default.

## Deprecated functions

The following functions are deprecated and will be removed in future versions of BayLum

* `Generate_DataFile()`
* `Generate_DataFile_MG()`
